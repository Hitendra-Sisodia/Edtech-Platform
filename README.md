Grocery Online Shopping Web App

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Grocery Online Shopping Web App! This project represents a transition from a Monolithic to a Microservices architecture, aimed at improving scalability, performance, and overall system efficiency. This is a practical source code of the NodeJS Microservice. In this we have split up a monolithic application into Microservices Architecture. The main goal of this repository is to provide an overview how the microservices architecture is working.

The prominent features of our project are:
1. Microservices Architecture: Spearheaded the migration from a Monolithic architecture to a Microservices-based structure. This approach allows for better modularity, independence, and scalability of various functionalities within the Grocery Online Shopping Web App.

2. Containerization with Docker: Implemented Docker to containerize individual microservices. This ensures consistency and efficiency in deployment across different environments, making the application more portable and easier to manage.

3. Microservices Design and Implementation: Designed and implemented specific microservices catering to different functionalities within the application. This enables a more modular and maintainable codebase, facilitating easier development, testing, and deployment.

4. Orchestration with Kubernetes: Leveraged Kubernetes for orchestration, simplifying the deployment, scaling, and management of microservices. Kubernetes provides a robust and flexible framework for automating containerized application workflows, ensuring seamless operation and scaling as per demand.
